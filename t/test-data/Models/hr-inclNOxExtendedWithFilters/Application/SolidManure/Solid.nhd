 Computes the annual NH3 emission from solid manure application.

 Attention: simplified model based on total N output from storage!!!

+description 

This process computes the annual average NH3 emission from solid
manure application (liquid/solid and deep litter). The standard
emission factor is corrected according to the TAN content and the
application rate, the application technology, the crops to which the
manure is applied, respected soft measures during application and the
application season, the time lag between application and
incorporation, the incorporation technology used, and the proportion
of solid manure that is applied on hot days.
