  Collects the annual emission of NH3 and the N flux for cattle 
 (apart from dairy cows).

+description 
  This process summarizes the annual emission of NH3 for cattle (apart from dairy cows) 
  from housing, yard and grazing. Further it summarizes the annual N flux from housing and yard to the storage for cattle.
